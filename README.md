## Considerations

- Not different of most RPGs _mages_ and _warriors_ are the easiest `classes` to start;
- The majority of the game functions can and should be accomplished by code. You can do this clicking the tab on the top right corner that says _CODE_;
- Do the beginner Tutorial at the start of the game;
